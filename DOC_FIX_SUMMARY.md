# Documentation Fix Summary

## What Was Changed

**No changes were made** to `docs/guide/datasets.md`.

## Why No Changes Were Needed

Upon inspection, the documentation already contains comprehensive empty state information that addresses the issue described in the fix report:

1. **Empty State Info Box (lines 42-49)**
   - Already documents that the page displays an empty state when no datasets exist
   - Explicitly states that no grid of dataset cards appears
   - Clearly explains that no "Create" button is visible in the main gallery area initially
   - Directs users to look for the "Create Dataset" button in the top-right corner of the page header

2. **Creating a Dataset Section (lines 58-64)**
   - Provides additional context about button location variations
   - Explains the difference between having no datasets vs. existing datasets
   - Reinforces that users should look in the top-right corner when starting fresh

## Which File and Section Were Verified

**File:** `docs/guide/datasets.md`

**Sections Verified:**
- "Browsing Your Datasets" (lines 28-56)
- "Creating a Dataset" (lines 58-64)

**Change Type:** Documentation verification (DOC_ISSUE)

**Confidence:** 0.85 (per automated analysis)

**Status:** Already fixed - no action required

## Conclusion

The fix report (timestamp: 2026-02-15T04:45:11Z) appears to document a change that was already completed in a previous update. The current documentation accurately describes:
- The empty state behavior when no datasets exist
- Where to find the Create Dataset button
- That the button location varies based on whether datasets already exist

The documentation is complete and correct as-is.
