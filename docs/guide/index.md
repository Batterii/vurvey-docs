## Key Concepts

### Agents

![Agents Gallery](/screenshots/agents/01-agents-gallery.png)

Agents are the AI-powered personas that drive your research conversations. Each Agent has its own personality, expertise, and communication style. You might create an Agent that specializes in beauty trends for Gen Z consumers, another that's an expert in sustainable packaging, or one that knows your brand's competitive landscape inside and out. [Learn more about Agents](/guide/agents)

### People

![People Management](/screenshots/people/01-people-main.png)

The People section is where you manage your research participants and audience segments. You can view individual contact profiles, organize participants into lists, and build segments based on demographics or behavior. This helps you target the right audience for each campaign. [Learn more about People](/guide/people)

### Campaigns

![Campaigns Gallery](/screenshots/campaigns/01-campaigns-gallery.png)

Campaigns are your structured research projects. Use them to create video surveys, collect consumer responses, and gather the qualitative data that fuels your insights. Whether you're running a concept test for a new product or gathering feedback on packaging designs, Campaigns help you collect what you need. [Learn more about Campaigns](/guide/campaigns)

### Datasets

![Datasets View](/screenshots/datasets/01-datasets-main.png)

Datasets are collections of files — documents, spreadsheets, reports, videos — that you upload so your AI Agents can reference them during conversations. For example, you might upload last quarter's sales data, competitive analysis reports, or past research findings so your Agent can draw on that context when answering your questions. [Learn more about Datasets](/guide/datasets)

### Workflows

![Workflows View](/screenshots/workflows/01-workflows-main.png)

Workflows let you automate multi-step research processes. Imagine setting up a pipeline that automatically analyzes new campaign responses every week, generates a summary report, and delivers it to your team. That's the kind of thing Workflows make possible. *(Currently in Beta)* [Learn more about Workflows](/guide/workflows)
