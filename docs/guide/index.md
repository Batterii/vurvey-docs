# Introduction to Vurvey

Welcome to Vurvey - the AI-powered consumer insights platform that combines artificial intelligence with real human insights through video surveys.

## What is Vurvey?

Vurvey transforms traditional market research by:

- **AI Agents** - Deploy AI personas that represent different consumer viewpoints and can analyze your research data
- **Video Surveys** - Collect rich, qualitative data through video responses from real participants
- **Rapid Insights** - Turn weeks of research into hours using AI analysis and summarization
- **Real Humans** - Combine AI with a network of 3+ million real consumers worldwide
- **Automated Workflows** - Build pipelines that automate recurring research tasks

## Platform Overview

After logging in, you'll land on the Home page (Chat Interface). The left sidebar provides navigation to all major sections:

| Sidebar Item | Section | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Home** | Chat Interface | AI-powered conversational research with agents |
| **Agents** | Agent Gallery | Create and manage AI personas |
| **Audience** | People Management | Manage populations, contacts, lists, and properties |
| **Campaigns** | Survey Management | Create and manage research surveys |
| **Datasets** | File Organization | Upload and organize files for AI analysis |
| **Workflow** | Automation (Beta) | Build automated multi-step research pipelines |

## Navigation

The left sidebar provides quick access to all sections. At the bottom, you'll find:
- Your user profile and email
- Current workspace indicator
- Settings and logout options

### Workspace-Scoped URLs

All pages in Vurvey are scoped to your workspace. URLs follow the pattern:
```
https://app.vurvey.com/{workspaceId}/agents
https://app.vurvey.com/{workspaceId}/audience
https://app.vurvey.com/{workspaceId}/campaigns
```

If you have access to multiple workspaces, you can switch between them using the workspace selector at the top of the sidebar.

## Key Concepts

### Agents (AI Personas)
AI-powered personas that can answer questions, analyze data, and simulate consumer perspectives. Each agent has a unique personality, expertise, and communication style.

### Populations
Groups of synthetic or real participants that agents can represent or analyze. Use populations to simulate different demographic segments in your research.

### Campaigns
Structured research surveys that collect responses from real participants or AI agents. Campaigns support video responses, multiple choice questions, and more.

### Datasets
Collections of files (documents, spreadsheets, videos) that AI agents can reference when answering questions. Upload your research data to give agents context.

### Workflows
Automated pipelines that combine agents, datasets, and campaigns to execute multi-step research processes on a schedule or in response to events.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Path

1. **Log in** - Access your Vurvey instance ([see Login guide](/guide/login))
2. **Explore the chat** - Ask questions in the Home chat interface
3. **Try different agents** - Switch agents to see different perspectives
4. **Upload data** - Add files to Datasets for AI analysis
5. **Create a campaign** - Launch a survey to collect real responses

### For Researchers
- Start with the [Chat Interface](/guide/home) to explore AI capabilities
- Create [Agents](/guide/agents) that match your research personas
- Build [Populations](/guide/people) for different demographic segments
- Launch [Campaigns](/guide/campaigns) to collect primary research

### For Analysts
- Upload data to [Datasets](/guide/datasets)
- Use **My Data** mode in chat to query your files
- Build [Workflows](/guide/workflows) to automate recurring analysis
