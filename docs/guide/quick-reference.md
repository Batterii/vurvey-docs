## Agent Builder: The 6 Steps

When you create a new agent, you'll walk through these steps:

| Step | Name | What You'll Do | Key Tip |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Objective** | Choose the agent type and define its mission | Be specific -- "analyze beauty trends for Gen Z" beats "help with research" |
| 2 | **Facets** | Select personality traits that shape how it communicates | Match demographics to your target audience |
| 3 | **Optional Settings** | Add knowledge, tools, datasets, and rules | Connect 1-3 focused datasets for best results |
| 4 | **Identity** | Set the agent's name, biography, and voice | Use the Generate button for AI-suggested names and bios |
| 5 | **Appearance** | Upload or generate an avatar image | Write specific physical descriptions for better AI-generated avatars |
| 6 | **Review** | Test the agent and activate it | Test with 10+ different questions before activating |

## Agent Types

| Type | Best For | Example Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **Assistant** | General-purpose help, Q&A, broad research tasks | Weekly survey analysis assistant |
| **Consumer Persona** | Simulating real consumer perspectives and feedback | Gen Z beauty enthusiast for concept testing |
| **Product** | Product-specific analysis and expertise | Product expert for your new skincare line |
| **Visual Generator** | Creating images and visual content | Mood board generator for brand refresh |

## AI Model Comparison

| Model | Speed | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Gemini Flash** | Fastest | Most everyday tasks, quick analysis, general Q&A |
| **Gemini Pro** | Medium | Deep reasoning, image/video analysis, complex tasks |
| **Claude** | Medium | Staying in character, nuanced instructions, natural writing |
| **GPT-4o** | Medium | Broad general knowledge, creative tasks |

::: tip When in Doubt
Start with **Gemini Flash** for most agents. Switch to **Claude** when persona consistency matters (consumer persona agents), or **Gemini Pro** when the agent needs to analyze visual content.

## Tips for Effective AI Prompting

Getting better results from Vurvey's AI starts with how you frame your questions:

### Be Specific
Instead of "Tell me about my data," try "What are the top 3 themes from my Q1 packaging survey, with supporting quotes for each?"

### Request a Format
Ask for tables, bullet points, numbered lists, or executive summaries to get organized output.

### Narrow Your Sources
Select one campaign or dataset at a time for more focused, accurate answers.

### Ask for Evidence
Include "with supporting quotes" or "cite your sources" in your prompt.

### Iterate and Drill Down
Ask follow-up questions to go deeper: "Tell me more about the second theme" or "Break that down by age group."

### Set Constraints
Tell the AI what to include or exclude: "Only use data from female respondents aged 25-34."

### Use Templates
Common prompt patterns for research:

| Task | Prompt Template |
|---|---|
| **Theme extraction** | "Identify the top [N] themes from [source]. For each theme, provide 2-3 supporting quotes." |
| **Executive summary** | "Write a [length] executive summary of [source] suitable for [audience]." |
| **Comparison** | "Compare [source A] vs [source B]. What are the key differences and similarities?" |
| **Sentiment analysis** | "Analyze the sentiment across all responses in [source]. Break down by positive, negative, and neutral." |
| **Recommendation** | "Based on the findings in [source], provide [N] actionable recommendations for [team/goal]." |
| **Trend identification** | "What trends or patterns emerge when looking at [source] over time?" |

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Chat isn't responding
1. Check your internet connection
2. Refresh the browser page
3. Try a different browser
4. Clear your browser cache and cookies
5. Check if an ad blocker or browser extension is interfering

### File upload failed
1. Make sure the file format is supported (see list above)
2. Check if the file exceeds the size limit
3. Try uploading again
4. If the file is very large, try splitting it into smaller parts
5. Check your internet connection stability

### Campaign won't launch
1. Check that all required fields are filled in
2. Verify your account has sufficient credits
3. Make sure at least one question is added
4. Preview the campaign to spot any issues
5. Look for validation error messages on the page

### Dataset stuck on "Processing"
1. Wait a moment -- processing can take time for large files (up to 30 minutes for video)
2. Refresh the page to get the latest status
3. If a file shows "Failed," click retry
4. Contact support if processing seems stuck for an extended period

### Workflow won't run
1. Check for validation errors in the workflow builder
2. Make sure all changes are saved
3. Verify that agents are assigned to each step
4. Try running it manually first before setting up a schedule
5. Check that all agent task prompts are filled in

### Agent responses seem off
1. Review the agent's mission and rules -- are they specific enough?
2. Check that the right datasets are connected
3. Try a different AI model
4. Test with simpler questions first to isolate the issue
5. Review the agent's facets for conflicting settings

### Can't share with a teammate
1. Make sure they have an account in your workspace
2. Check that you have Share permission on the resource
3. Try searching for their name or email in the share dialog
4. Ask your workspace administrator if they can help

### Search results seem outdated
1. Web search pulls current information -- but results depend on what's available online
2. Try rephrasing your search query
3. Include specific date ranges in your question: "What happened in [topic] in the last 30 days?"
