## Tips for Effective AI Prompting

Getting better results from Vurvey's AI starts with how you frame your questions:

- **Be specific**: Instead of "Tell me about my data," try "What are the top 3 themes from my Q1 packaging survey?"
- **Request a format**: Ask for tables, bullet points, or numbered lists to get organized output
- **Narrow your sources**: Select one campaign or dataset at a time for more focused, accurate answers
- **Ask for evidence**: Include "with supporting quotes" or "cite your sources" in your prompt
- **Iterate**: Ask follow-up questions to drill deeper into initial findings
- **Set constraints**: Tell the AI what to include or exclude -- "Only use data from female respondents aged 25-34"

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Chat isn't responding
1. Check your internet connection
2. Refresh the browser page
3. Try a different browser
4. Clear your browser cache and cookies

### File upload failed
1. Make sure the file format is supported (see list above)
2. Check if the file is too large
3. Try uploading again
4. If the file is very large, try splitting it into smaller parts

### Campaign won't launch
1. Check that all required fields are filled in
2. Verify your account has sufficient credits
3. Preview the campaign to spot any issues
4. Look for validation error messages on the page

### Dataset stuck on "Processing"
1. Wait a moment -- processing can take time for large files
2. Refresh the page to get the latest status
3. If a file shows "Failed," click retry
4. Contact support if processing seems stuck for an extended period

### Workflow won't run
1. Check for validation errors in the workflow builder
2. Make sure all changes are saved
3. Verify that agents are assigned to each step
4. Try running it manually first before setting up a schedule
