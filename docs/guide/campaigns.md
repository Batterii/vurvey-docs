# Campaigns

Campaigns are video-powered consumer research studies that capture authentic feedback through structured questions and open-ended video responses. Launch a survey, hear directly from your audience, and let AI surface the insights that matter.

## Overview

![Campaigns Dashboard](/screenshots/campaigns/01-campaigns-gallery.png)

The Campaigns section is your research command center. From here you can create new studies, manage active campaigns, browse templates, track usage, and create AI-powered highlight reels from video responses.

::: tip More Than Traditional Surveys
Campaigns go beyond standard surveys by capturing the emotions, expressions, and authentic voices of your respondents on video. Combine structured questions (ratings, rankings, multiple choice) with open-ended video responses for richer insights that quantitative data alone can't provide.
:::

## Navigation Tabs

The Campaigns page has four tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **All Campaigns** | Dashboard view of all your campaigns |
| **Templates** | Browse categorized campaign templates to get started quickly |
| **Usage** | View workspace analytics and credit consumption |
| **Magic Reels** | AI-generated video highlight reels from campaign responses |

## All Campaigns

The default view displays your campaigns in a card grid layout. Each card shows the campaign name, creator, video preview thumbnails from responses, and key metadata.

### Status Badges

A colored badge on each card indicates where the campaign is in its lifecycle:

| Status | Color | What It Means |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Draft** | Cyan | Still being built — not yet collecting responses |
| **Open** | Lime Green | Live and actively collecting responses |
| **Closed** | Red | Collection complete, ready for analysis |
| **Blocked** | Teal | Temporarily paused |
| **Archived** | Teal | Inactive but preserved for reference |

::: tip Status Best Practices
- Keep campaigns in **Draft** until you've tested them with Preview mode
- **Close** campaigns once you've met your response goals
- **Archive** rather than delete to preserve your data
- Use **Blocked** sparingly — only for urgent issues like inappropriate responses
:::

### Campaign Card Details

Each card displays metadata chips at the bottom:

| Chip | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Questions** | Number of questions in the campaign |
| **Duration** | Total video minutes collected |
| **Credits** | Credit reward amount (if using incentives) |
| **AI Summary** | Indicates AI insights are available |

### Campaign Card Actions

Click the three-dot menu on any campaign card to:

- **Start Conversation** — Open an AI chat to analyze campaign data (available when the campaign has responses)
- **Share** — Manage who can access this campaign
- **Preview** — Open the campaign editor
- **Copy** — Duplicate the campaign
- **Delete** — Permanently remove the campaign

### Filtering and Sorting

Use the controls above the card grid to filter by status (Open, Draft, Closed, Blocked, Archived) and sort by name, update date, response count, video minutes, and more.

::: tip Find What Needs Attention
Sort by **Response Count (Low)** to find campaigns that need more responses. Sort by **Oldest Updated** to spot stale drafts. Filter by **Open** to focus on active studies.
:::

## Creating Campaigns

Click **Create Campaign** to start a new study. You have three options:

### Manual

Start with a blank campaign and build your questions from scratch. Best when you need complete control over the research design.

### From Template

Use a pre-built research pattern. Browse templates by category, preview the included questions, click **Use Template**, then customize for your needs.

### From Objectives (AI-Powered)

Describe your research goals in plain language and let AI generate appropriate questions:

1. **Enter your objectives** — For example: "Understand how Gen Z consumers feel about our new packaging design"
2. **Review AI-generated questions** — Edit, remove, or reorder as needed
3. **Configure and launch** — Set your campaign settings, incentives, and targeting

::: tip Get the Best AI-Generated Questions
Be specific about what you want to learn. Include your target audience and the topics you want to explore. The AI suggestions are starting points — always review and customize before launching.

## Launching Campaigns

### Launch Flow

The launch flow has two steps:

1. **Group** — Configure your audience targeting and campaign settings
2. **Members** — Select who receives the campaign

### Audience Targeting

When launching, you can target three types of audiences:

| Audience Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Populations** | AI-generated consumer profiles for synthetic testing |
| **Mailing List** | Contacts from your People section (lists, segments, or individual contacts) |
| **Vurvey Creators** | Vurvey's network of qualified research participants |

### Pre-Launch Checklist

Before launching, verify:

- All questions are configured and reviewed
- Campaign settings and incentives are finalized
- Targeting is set to reach the right audience
- You've tested with Preview mode on both mobile and desktop
- Start and end dates are correct

### After Launch

Once your campaign is Open:

- Monitor responses as they come in
- Check response quality early to catch issues
- Watch for technical problems
- Close the campaign when you've reached your response goals

## Campaign Results

### Viewing Responses

The Results tab shows summary statistics — total responses, completion rate, average duration, and total video minutes collected. Click any individual response to see:

- **Video playback** with speed controls and download options
- **AI-generated transcript** with timestamps you can click to jump to specific moments
- **All question answers** and response metadata

### AI Insights

AI automatically analyzes your campaign data and surfaces:

- **Overall themes and patterns** across all responses
- **Sentiment analysis** showing how respondents feel
- **Key findings** summarized for quick review
- **Question-level breakdowns** highlighting common themes and notable outliers

### Creating Highlights

Mark compelling moments from video responses as highlights. You can create them from the video player, select text in the transcript, or let AI suggest the best moments automatically.

### Exporting Data

Export campaign results in multiple formats — CSV for spreadsheet analysis, video downloads, transcript exports, and PDF reports for stakeholders.

## Templates

![Templates Page](/screenshots/campaigns/03-templates.png)

Browse pre-built campaign templates organized by category. Each template shows a headline, description, question count, suggested incentive, and estimated completion time.

Templates are starting points. After selecting one, customize the questions, adjust incentives, add your branding, and test thoroughly before launching.

::: tip Use Case
Need quick feedback on three product concepts before a board meeting? Start with a "Concept Test" template, upload your concept images, and launch to your target panel — all in under an hour.
:::

## Usage

![Usage Page](/screenshots/campaigns/04-usage.png)

Track your workspace activity and credit consumption. The Usage tab shows response trends over time, community growth, total video minutes collected, and detailed credit usage breakdowns.

Credits are consumed when respondents complete campaigns with incentives, when AI processes video responses, when Magic Reels are generated, and when advanced AI features are used.

::: tip Manage Your Budget
Check usage before launching large campaigns. Set response limits to control costs. Use AI populations for initial testing rounds — it's a cost-effective way to validate your questions before going live.
:::

## Magic Reels

![Magic Reels](/screenshots/campaigns/05-magic-reels.png)

Magic Reels are AI-powered video highlight compilations created from your campaign responses. They're perfect for sharing consumer voices with stakeholders, creating presentation-ready content, or building a library of authentic customer testimonials.

### Reel Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Published** | Ready to view and share |
| **Draft** | Not yet published |
| **Processing** | Video being generated |
| **Failed** | Generation encountered an error |
| **Unpublished Changes** | Has updates that haven't been published yet |

### Creating a Reel

1. Click **Add Reel**
2. Select the campaign(s) to draw clips from
3. Choose AI-generated (AI picks the best moments) or manual (you select clips)
4. Preview and edit — trim clips, reorder, add or remove
5. Click **Publish** when ready

### Sharing Reels

Published reels can be shared via direct link, embedded in websites, downloaded as video files, or shared with your team.

::: tip Effective Highlight Reels
- Keep reels under 3 minutes for maximum engagement
- Include diverse clips for a representative sample
- Focus on emotional moments that resonate with stakeholders
- Create separate reels for different audiences (executives, product team, marketing)
- Share while insights are fresh
:::

## Campaign Lifecycle

A campaign flows through these statuses:

```
Draft → Open → Closed → Archived
         ↓
      Blocked → Open (resume) or Closed
```

| Transition | What Happens |
|------------|-------------|
| **Draft → Open** | Campaign goes live and starts collecting responses |
| **Open → Closed** | Campaign stops accepting new responses |
| **Open → Blocked** | Campaign is temporarily paused |
| **Blocked → Open** | Campaign resumes collecting responses |
| **Closed → Archived** | Campaign moves to long-term storage |

## Common Workflows

### Test Campaign Questions Before Going Live

1. Create your campaign and add all questions
2. In the launch flow, target an **AI Population** matching your audience demographics
3. Collect simulated responses and review — are the questions clear? Are you getting useful variety?
4. Refine questions based on the AI feedback
5. Relaunch to real participants with confidence

### Launch a Video Survey to Hear from Gen Z Consumers

1. Create a campaign from objectives: "Understand Gen Z preferences for sustainable packaging"
2. Include a mix of video questions ("Tell us about a recent purchase where packaging influenced your decision") and rating questions
3. Target a segment of Gen Z consumers from your People section
4. Monitor responses as they come in
5. Use AI Insights to surface themes and create a Magic Reel for your stakeholders

### Create a Shareable Highlight Reel from Campaign Responses

1. After your campaign closes, go to **Magic Reels**
2. Click **Add Reel** and select your campaign
3. Let AI pick the best clips or hand-select your favorites
4. Edit the reel — trim clips, reorder for narrative flow
5. Publish and share the link with your team or clients

## Troubleshooting

### Low Response Rates

- **Check your incentive** — Is it competitive for your audience?
- **Review campaign length** — Shorter surveys get higher completion rates
- **Verify targeting** — Is the right audience receiving the invitation?
- **Test the link** — Make sure the campaign URL works
- **Send reminders** — Follow up with non-responders

### AI Insights Not Generating

- Wait for processing — AI needs time after responses are submitted
- Most features require at least 5-10 responses
- Refresh the page — insights may have loaded
- Videos must be transcribed before AI can analyze them

### Campaign Won't Launch

- Check that all required fields are completed
- Verify at least one question is added
- Review date ranges and targeting settings
- Confirm incentives are properly configured (if using payments)
