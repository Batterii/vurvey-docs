# Logging In

This guide walks you through signing in to Vurvey so you can get started with your research.

## Opening Vurvey

To access Vurvey, open your web browser and go to the Vurvey URL provided by your organization. You'll see the Vurvey welcome screen with your sign-in options.

## Sign-In Options

Vurvey offers three ways to sign in, depending on how your organization has configured access:

| Option | When to Use |
|---|---|
| **Sign in with Google** | If your organization uses Google Workspace, this is the fastest way in. Just click and select your Google account. |
| **Sign in with email** | Use this if you have a Vurvey-specific email and password. |
| **Sign in with SSO** | If your company uses enterprise single sign-on (such as Okta or Azure AD), select this option and follow your company's login flow. |

::: tip Which option should I choose?
If you're not sure which sign-in method to use, check with your team or workspace administrator. Most organizations will have a preferred method already set up for you.

2. Enter the **email address** associated with your Vurvey account
3. Click **Next**
4. Enter your **password**

## What You'll See After Signing In

Once you've signed in successfully, you'll land on the **Home** page — your main workspace for AI-powered conversations. From here, you can start chatting with an AI Agent right away, or use the sidebar to navigate to any section of the platform.

The left sidebar gives you quick access to all of Vurvey's features: Home, Agents, People, Campaigns, Datasets, Forecast, and Workflow. You'll also see your workspace name and your profile at the bottom.

## Switching Workspaces

If you belong to more than one workspace — for example, if you work across different brands or teams — you can switch between them using the workspace selector at the top of the sidebar. Just click your current workspace name and choose the one you'd like to work in.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't sign in?

- Double-check that you're entering the correct email address
- Make sure Caps Lock is off when typing your password
- Look for a "Forgot Password" link on the sign-in screen to reset your password
- If you're still having trouble, reach out to your workspace administrator for help

### SSO not working?

- Make sure you're selecting the correct SSO provider for your organization
- Try clearing your browser's cache and cookies, then sign in again
- Check with your IT department to confirm your SSO access is configured

## Next Steps
