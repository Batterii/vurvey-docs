  "change_summary": "Updated documentation to reflect UI variations in agent builder. Added note about simplified single-page builder interface that some workspaces may see, in addition to the documented step-based guided builder. Qualified all step-by-step instructions with '(Guided Builder)' to clarify they apply to the step-based interface, not the simplified single-page form.",
  "lines_changed": "172-206 (Builder Navigation section), plus step headings throughout",
  "reason": "QA test couldn't find step tabs or generate-agent modal fields. Screenshot shows a simplified single-page builder interface with Bio and Behaviors sections, which differs from the documented 6-step guided builder. Documentation needed to acknowledge multiple builder interface variations.",
