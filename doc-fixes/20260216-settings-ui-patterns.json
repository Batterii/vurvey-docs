For Workspace Name: documented that the name is not directly editable via input field; instead, users must click the 'Edit' button. For AI Models: added explanation that workspaces may show empty state or 'No AI models available' message depending on plan and configuration. Model cards may not appear on first load for free/trial workspaces.",
